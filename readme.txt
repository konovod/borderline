1. Story
	Year 2109 will remain in annals of history as a Year of First Contact. We discovered that we are not alone in a Universe. Aliens come on their ship through warp point located at orbit of Saturn. At first, it seems the triumph. But later... it turns into disappointment. We just can't understand them. They are (perhaps) trying to communicate, and we are trying too, without progress. Translation? Huh, we don't even know if they have a language. They seems do have completely different motives, emotions, society. Basic science laws? Well, it seems impossible, but their science is too different from us. We show them Pythagorean theorem, they answers with something like Venn's diagram. Wee show them Venn's diagrams, they answer with something like fractal triangles. They consider physics as a subdiscipline of culinary arts (or is it linguistic?) and mathematics as a part of biology. Looks like they still have an instinct of self-preservation, but we can't be sure, as their behavior is too cryptic. There was only one field where they are like us - first of their ships have something that definitely looked like weapons.
	Thousands of theories checked, but every one that provide useful conjectures was eventually proven wrong. Looks like it is a cryptogram, either our or their mind (or both) were somehow encrypted to prevent mutual understanding.
	Five years later, contacts still continue, but become yet another PhD's topic, without useful yields. You was the man who changed all.
	It's pretty long story, but as a short: you have killed crew of one explorer alien ships. Due to the moment of murder, ship now recognise you as a captain and you can use warp pointt on it. As a response, aliens destroyed our colony on Mars. And perhaps will destroy all other colonies, but your clever maneuver stopped them. Now it is a war, and everybody knows only the second part of story - that you managed to get alien ship and saved us from alien agression on it.
	We don't know if alien will return and destroy us, but we can't risk, so out only choise is to attack first.

2. Warp points. 
	They are connecting many habitable worlds forming something like a grid. Travelling through them is immediate for a traveller but takes about a year for the ones who remains on planet. Using one ship that can open warp point, we can send any number of ships through it, but there is no other ways to communicate - our technology is too far from copying the ship and sending signals in normal space is pretty useless. So your ship is only way to move ships and information through gates.
	
2. Controls
	Mouse only.
	
3. Gameplay
	You must move between star systems capturing and colonizing them, build minefields preventing aliens from destroying your colonies, and finally discover the way to end this war. 
	Research: choose one field that will have higher priority. Systems make dicoveries independently at random, and when you visit them you take their knowledge and give it to other visited systems.
	Manage: choose what how the system will split workpower: build ships, build mines, rest is used for research. 
	Ships: All ships that planet built from your last visit are automatically added to your fleet. They have different technology levels (depending on research on planet) and purpose:
	- Branders are your main way to destory enemy ships. They are kamikadze ship that get close to enemy and explode penetrating all their shields and armor.
	- Cruisers are less powerful but also less cruel way, they can also be used to suppress orbital defenses. 
	- Marine bots land on planet and conquer it
	- Minesweepers counter some number of alien mines.
	- Colonizers are required to make a colony in cleaned systems.
	- Scouts.... well, aren't implemented it this version, sorry.
	
	Battles. Just go forward till you win. Sometimes it is better to retreat, but enemies still get some shots to you.
	Winning. Well, as a spoiler, to start story continue and eventually win you havee to capture system that is far enough from Sun.
